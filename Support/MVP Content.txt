✔️ Skill Features That Work Well in Probability:
Feature	Applies to Probability?	How
✅ direct_formula_use	✅	Use of P(A) = favorable/total, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B), etc.
✅ factual_recall_only	✅	Definitions: mutually exclusive, independent, etc.
✅ algebraic_manipulation	✅	Solving equations involving P(A ∩ B) = P(A)·P(B
✅ multi_step_reasoning	✅	Use of total probability + conditional or multiple case work
✅ conceptual_choice	✅	Whether to use complement, Bayes, binomial, etc.
✅ multi_formula_linking	✅	P(A ∪ B) with inclusion-exclusion + Venn interpretation
✅ combined_concepts	✅	Combinatorics + conditional probability, Pascal’s triangle in binomial setting
✅ reverse_thinking	✅	Infer favorable cases from options, or inverse logic in Bayes
✅ trap_or_misconception	✅	Confusing disjoint vs. independent, or misapplying replacement logic
✅ option_elimination_required	✅	Use dimensionality, pattern, logic
✅ approximation_or_assumption	⚠️ (Rare)	May appear in word problems where small probabilities are ignored
✅ boundary_case_check	✅	Probability as n→∞, or events with P = 0 or P = 1
✅ simple_diagram_interpretation	✅	Venn diagrams or sample spaces
✅ simple_graph_interpretation	✅	Could be relevant for discrete vs. continuous distributions (binomial curves)
✅ graph_sketching_required	⚠️ (Rare)	Possible in distributions (binomial, geometric)
✅ deep_conceptual	✅	Why mutually exclusive ≠ independent; interpretation of expected value/variance
✅ frame_of_reference_change	⚠️ (Not relevant)	This is primarily physics-based
✅ unit_conversion	❌	Not applicable in probability
✅ reaction_mechanism_reasoning	❌	Specific to chemistry
✅ graphical_derivation	❌	Rare in probability, unless using visual proof from bar graph or area
