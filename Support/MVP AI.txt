🧠 Where You Should Use the AI Bot
🔍 Area	Why Use AI	What AI Can Do
1. Personalized Recommendations	High value	Analyze user stats → Suggest topics, quizzes, levels, and goals. (like a mentor)
2. Question Generation	Once during content creation or periodically	Generate unique, non-repeating, difficulty-tagged MCQs for new topics
3. Question Mutation / Reskinning	Medium value	Generate rephrased/variant versions of questions to avoid repetition
4. Performance Feedback (Post-quiz) Medium-high	Give motivating, specific feedback: “You nailed the easy ones, but need to speed up on dice questions.”
5. Hint or Explanation Generator	Optional but cool	Generate or simplify explanations for questions the user gets wrong
6. Chat-based Learning Assistant (optional UX)	Nice to have	“Why is the answer A?” → AI answers in plain English (like Socratic tutor)
