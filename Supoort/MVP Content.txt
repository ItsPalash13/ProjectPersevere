Probability

🔢 Recommended Levels: 10 to 15 Levels
This gives enough granularity for:

Purpose	Reason
🧠 Cognitive Load	Don’t overload learners—3 to 5 new concepts per level max
🎯 Gamification	Frequent progress boosts motivation and retention
⛰️ Difficulty Curve	You can start simple and increase challenge gradually
🧩 Topic Coverage	Distribute 34 topics meaningfully across levels

🎯 Suggested Distribution (Example: 12 Levels)
Level	Topics
1	Basic Probability Formula, Sample Space, Favorable Outcomes
2	Tossing Coins (1 & 2), Rolling Dice (1 & 2)
3	Drawing from Deck (1 & 2), Simple vs Compound Events
4	Equally Likely Outcomes, Mutually Exclusive, Complementary
5	Certain/Impossible Events, Not A (Complement Rule), Word Problems
6	Independent vs Dependent Events
7	Union & Intersection of Events
8	Conditional Probability, Tree Diagrams
9	“At Least / At Most / Exactly” Probabilities
10	Combinatorics: Pascal’s Triangle, nCr
11	Permutations & Combinations in Probability
12	Bayes’, Total Probability, Binomial, Geometric, Expected Value, Variance
