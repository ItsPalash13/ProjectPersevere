# 📊 Learning Ability Modeling & Chapter Rating System – Summary Report

---

## 1. 🎯 Goal

To define a **numerical and interpretable rating system** that:
- Accurately reflects a student's **true understanding** at topic and chapter level
- Adapts over time based on question difficulty, correctness, and time
- Remains **scalable** across ~75 JEE chapters and hundreds of topics

---

## 2. ✅ Chosen Rating Model: ELO-Style System

### Why ELO?
- Balances **accuracy + difficulty**
- Learns dynamically over time
- Encourages **mastery progression**
- Simple to implement and track

### ELO Formula (with time factor):

Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^((Q_difficulty - Student_rating) / 400))
TimeFactor = max(0.5, min(1.5, MedianTime / TimeTaken))
Delta_Rating = K × (Actual - Expected) × TimeFactor
NewRating = OldRating + Delta_Rating

yaml
Copy
Edit

- `K` = learning rate (e.g. 32, or scale it dynamically)
- `Actual` = 1 if correct, 0 if incorrect
- TimeFactor rewards speed

---

## 3. 🧩 Topic Ratings to Chapter Rating

Each topic has:
- `TopicRatingᵢ` (ELO score)
- `Attemptsᵢ` (number of attempts)

### Basic Chapter Rating Formula:

ChapterRating = Σ (TopicRatingᵢ × Attemptsᵢ) / Σ Attemptsᵢ

shell
Copy
Edit

### Capped Weighted Version (Prevents domination by one topic):

ChapterRating = Σ (TopicRatingᵢ × min(Attemptsᵢ, Cap)) / Σ min(Attemptsᵢ, Cap)

yaml
Copy
Edit

> Recommended: `Cap = 30` attempts per topic

## 4. 🏷️ Labels for Chapter & Topics

### ✅ Simple 3-Level System for Topics

| Rating Range | Label     | Meaning                    |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| `< 550`      | Beginner  | Weak or just started       |
| `550–650`    | Learning  | Progressing with practice  |
| `> 650`      | Confident | Strong and consistent      |

### 🎓 Optional Granular Labels for Chapters

| Rating Range | Label     |
|--------------|-----------|
| `< 500`      | Novice    |
| 500–600      | Learning  |
| 600–700      | Competent |
| `> 700`      | Advanced  |

## 5. ❌ Dropped Feature: Freshness / Time Decay

### Removed for MVP:
- Adds complexity
- Not essential at this stage
- Can be revisited to model forgetting in future updates

---

## 6. 🧠 Design Guidelines

### ✅ Display in UI:
- Show **label + rating + accuracy + avg time** per topic
- Show **normalized progress bar + label** per chapter

### ❌ Avoid:
- Showing labels for every topic-set
- Overloading user with 20+ labels at once

---

## 7. 🔧 Data Stored Per User Per Topic

```json
{
  "userId": "U123",
  "topic": "Work-Energy Theorem",
  "rating": 625,
  "attempts": 47,
  "accuracy": 68,
  "avgTime": 48,
  "label": "Learning"
}
8. 🚀 Optional Future Enhancements
Feature	Description
🔄 Time decay	Model forgetting over time
📊 Difficulty ladder	Tiered levels per topic (easy → advanced)
🔐 Unlocking progression	Require “Confident” to unlock hard problems
📈 Session graphs	Show trend over attempts (accuracy, rating)
