📌 Core Idea:
A single well-constructed JEE question often:

Pulls concepts from multiple topics (e.g., SHM + Friction + Energy),

Tests various depths of thinking, from recall to creative synthesis (i.e., Bloom’s Taxonomy levels 1 to 6).

🎓 Detailed Breakdown of the 6 Bloom’s Taxonomy Levels (Adapted for JEE)
Level	What it Tests (JEE Context)	Example Skill
1. Remembering	Recall basic facts, formulas, constants, or definitions.	- State Coulomb’s Law.
- Recall the formula for the nth term of an AP.
- Identify hybridization of C in CH₄.
2. Understanding	Interpret or explain concepts, diagrams, or physical setups.	- Explain what a velocity-time graph implies.
- Describe the effect of a dielectric in a capacitor.
- Understand limiting reagent.
3. Applying	Use known formulas and techniques to solve straightforward, familiar problems.	- Use Gauss’s law to find electric field.
- Apply kinematics equations.
- Use molarity equation to find concentration.
4. Analyzing	Break down complex systems, identify patterns, and connect ideas across topics.	- Decompose forces on an inclined plane.
- Break a function into parts to check continuity.
- Compare reaction pathways.
5. Evaluating	Make decisions, compare solution methods, check reasonableness, or judge feasibility.	- Choose between different circuit arrangements.
- Compare integration methods.
- Determine if a reaction is thermodynamically feasible.
6. Creating	Combine knowledge from multiple areas to derive, prove, design, or propose something new.	- Derive the equation of motion under non-uniform acceleration.
- Design an experiment to verify Ohm’s law.
- Propose a synthetic route in organic chemistry.

🧩 Example (Physics)
Question: A block attached to a spring on a rough horizontal surface is compressed and released. Derive how far it moves before coming to rest, and find the condition under which it won’t return to equilibrium.
